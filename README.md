# LearnMorse

a Blazor web app for learning morse code

this is a work in progress

current features:
- standard lessons (A-E, U-Z, etc.)
- user custom lessons

planned features:
- user practice lessons
- recommended practice lessons (generated from the users' "weakest" characters)
- prettier layout

tweaks to do:
- wait for clip to play before transitioning to next question
- change morse input threshholds to be more responsive
